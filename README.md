# SmallProgramsCpp
There are homeworks done by me during realisation of Programming and Algorithmics 2 while summer semester 2018/2019 at Czech Technical University in Prague.

In every directory you can find main file in which I there is the solution of the task. There is also Makefile to simplify process of compiling and executing the program. For every task there is a description provided.

Those problems are mainly focused on simple algorithmic problems and using of OOP in C++.
