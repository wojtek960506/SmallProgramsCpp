# SmallProgramsCpp
There are homeworks done by me during realisation of Programming and Algorithmics 2 while summer semester 2018/2019 at Czech Technical University in Prague.

In every directory you can find main file in which there is the solution of the task. There is also Makefile to simplify process of compiling and executing the program. For every task I provided a short description.

Those problems are mainly focused on simple algorithmic problems, Object Oriented Programming and synthax features in C++.

After successfully passing this course I uploaded those homeworks to this public repository.
